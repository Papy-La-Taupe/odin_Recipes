    <h4>A Classic and delicious cookie recipe</h4>
    
    <p>We all have a history with traditional cookies. We enjoyed them when we were kids, sometimes learnt to bake them with our mom or dad, we share them with our friends or used them when we were sad as comfort food,...</p>
    <p> The simple reality of it is that we all love them, but time being what it is, when we want to bake them, we often forgot how to do it. So here is a humble walkthrough the steps of baking those little pleasures. </p>
